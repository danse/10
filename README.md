This is a presentation for the Berlin JS meeting, 18 July 2013

Go to <http://danse.github.io/18> to see it online

# Contents

There is not so much text into the presentation, but it can be useful as a
collection of links about d3. I would like to convert it to a flat structure
but i'm not aware of alternative style sheets for reveal js and i won't write
one now.

# How to

If you wonder how i wrote it, it's reveal js, with the markup generated from a
jade template
